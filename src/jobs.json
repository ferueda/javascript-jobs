Then the fun starts!\n\n\nThe current tech stack is C#, .NETCORE, Angular, DynamoDB and PostgreSQL with a very heavy reliance on AWS on a monolithic platform. The future stack will rely heavily on React/React Native, (even more) AWS, and a DevOps mindset in a newly built microserviced architecture.\n\n\nThis role will be great for a hands on Solutions Architect who still enjoys coding, but who is ready to take responsibility of their own environment. On top of fantastic technical skills, we will need you to have excellent documentation experience, great leaderships skills and an ability to present your ideas and findings to an executive leadership team (including Founder and the Board).\n\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the role, company and opportunity, please reach out to me for more details. sean@theonset.com.au / 0407 932 548.",
